Coming from Carson, California, Keem's music is a vibrant tapestry of West Coast Rap influences, trap beats, and impressive lyricism. Much of his childhood was spent in music studios as he watched his aunts and uncles burn CDs as his mother struggled with substance abuse and his father was not an active parental figure. He always expressed an interest in rapping, but was not confident with his naturally high-pitched voice and chose to wait until it was developed. Keem began his music journey and released many songs and EPs in 2014s-2018s with contributions to \"Black Panther : The Album\" but it was t was the sleeper hit \"Orange Soda\" on \"Die for my bitch \" in 2019 that catapulted him into the spotlight.",
		"Card2": "\"Orange Soda\" helped Keem get on the charts which allowed him to do his first concert tours. Keem then debuted his studio album, \"The Melodic Blue \", in 2021 where he had positive commercial success. His ability to blend his sound with other music giants is extremely impressive for an upcoming artist. One song specifically \"Family Ties\" with Kendrick Lamar was a major hit, netting him and Kendrick Best Rap Performance at the Grammy Award's 2022. Not to mention, Kedrick Lamar, 17 time GRAMMY Award winner and one of the most influential rappers of all time, is Keem's older cousin. This relationship definitely helped with Keem's breakthrough but many can agree he is a star in his own right and is one of the most exciting young voices in hip-hop right now. Keem has teased his next album and I am definitely looking forward to it.",
